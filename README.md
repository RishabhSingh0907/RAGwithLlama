# RAG with Llama

Llama is a framework that serves as a tool for developers to build RAG applications. It's an easy to use and deploy tool.
Here, in this repository I have used this framework to create a simple RAG application that can be used for extracting information from pdf documents. The number of documents can be any. But the only condition here is, all the documents that would be used for information retriecal shall be stored in a seperate common directory.
